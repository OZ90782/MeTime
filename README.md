# MeTime
A simple yet functional habit tracker developed in Python, focusing on promoting regular breaks and relaxation exercises to support mental well-being and mindfulness in daily life.

## What it is

MeTime is a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to help users track habits that support mental health, such as taking screen breaks, guided meditations, short breathing exercises, or movement/stretching breaks.

Key features include:

* **Habit Management:** Create, delete, and mark habits as completed.

* **Periodicity:** Supports both daily and weekly habits.

* **Tracking:** Automatically tracks habit creation dates and completion timestamps.

* **Streaks:** Calculates current and longest run streaks for habits.

* **Analytics:** Provides insights into habit performance, including habits with the same periodicity, longest streaks, and identifying "struggling habits" (most frequently missed).

* **Data Persistence:** All habit data is stored locally in JSON files between user sessions, ensuring your data remains private and accessible.

## Installation

MeTime is built using **Python 3.7 or later**. It relies solely on Python's built-in standard libraries, so there are no external dependencies to install.

To set up the project:

1.  **Clone or download** the project files to your local machine.

2.  **Navigate** to the project directory in your terminal.
